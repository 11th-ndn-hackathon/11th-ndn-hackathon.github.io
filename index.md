We are hosting a two-day virtual NDN Hackathon (May 22-23, 2021). The event is open and FREE to participate in and winners will receive exciting FREE prizes! This event targets all levels of participants and, particularly for beginners, will be an excellent opportunity to get started with NDN.

We particularly encourage projects that:

 - Directly address NDN research needs,
 - Create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - Create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
